## Our dataset
This dataset describe the amount of .....
To get better known of our dataset:
```{r}
str(chickwts)
summary(chickwts)
```
to get the mean and the SD of the dataset
```{r}
chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            avg = mean(weight), 
            sd1 = sd(weight)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
## Including Plots
```{r}
ggplot (chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, 
               fun.args = list(mult = 1), 
               col = "red")
